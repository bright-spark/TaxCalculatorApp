Reusable Blocks are Modules [https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y164]

Create modules that represent reusable application blocks for common services such as exception handling, logging, diagnostics, security, and local data stashing.

Why?: These types of features are needed in many applications, so by keeping them separated in their own modules they can be application generic and be reused across applications.
